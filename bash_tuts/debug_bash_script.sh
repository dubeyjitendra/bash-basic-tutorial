#################   Debugging, testing and  shortcuts


# In order to debug your bash scripts, you can use -x when executing your scripts:

bash -x ./debug_bash_script.sh


# Or you can add set -x before the speciﬁc line that you want to debug,
# set -x enables a mode of the shell where all executed commands are
# printed to the terminal.


# Another way to test your scripts is to use this fantastic tool here:

https://www.shellcheck.net/

# You can also run the tool directly in your terminal:
