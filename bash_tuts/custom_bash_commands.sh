# The following netstat command would show us how many TCP connections on port 80 and 443 we currently have:

netstat -plant | grep '80\|443' | grep -v LISTEN | wc -l

# All we need to do in this case is to run the following command:

alias conn="netstat -plant | grep '80\|443' | grep -v LISTEN | wc -l"

# That way we are creating an alias called conn which would essentially be a 'shortcut' for our long netstat command. Now if you run just conn:

conn
